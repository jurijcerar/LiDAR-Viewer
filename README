# LiDAR Viewer 

This program allows you to view LiDAR data and perform Kruskal's algorithm on the data points to create a MST.

To load data write the path of the file you wish to open. The file must be LAS format 1.2 with point data record version 1. 
Any other versions of LAS files won't work! 

When making this, we used data from: https://gis.arso.gov.si/evode/profile.aspx?id=atlas_voda_Lidar@Arso
The LAZ format can be converted into LAS using pdal (pipeline example in tests folder)

To move around use arrow keys and the right mouse button.

The kruskal graph is created either based on distance between points or based on their intensity. 
This can be chosen with the checkbox.
